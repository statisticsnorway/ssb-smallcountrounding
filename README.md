### A statistical disclosure control tool to protect frequency tables in cases where small values are sensitive

The main function, 
[PLSrounding()](https://statisticsnorway.github.io/ssb-smallcountrounding/reference/PLSrounding.html), 
performs small count rounding of necessary inner cells (Heldal, 2017)
so that all small frequencies of cross-classifications to be published (publishable cells) are rounded. This is equivalent to changing micro data since frequencies of unique combinations are changed. Thus, additivity and consistency are guaranteed.
This is performed by an algorithm inspired by partial least squares regression (Langsrud and Heldal, 2018).

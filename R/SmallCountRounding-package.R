#' Small Count Rounding of Tabular Data 
#' 
#' A statistical disclosure control tool to protect frequency tables in cases where small values are sensitive.
#' The main function, \code{\link{PLSrounding}}, performs small count rounding of necessary inner cells (Heldal, 2017) 
#' so that all small frequencies of cross-classifications to be published (publishable cells) are rounded. 
#' This is equivalent to changing micro data since frequencies of unique combinations are changed. 
#' Thus, additivity and consistency are guaranteed.
#' This is performed by an algorithm inspired by partial least squares regression (Langsrud and Heldal, 2018). \cr

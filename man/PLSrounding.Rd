\title{PLS inspired rounding}
\usage{
PLSrounding(data, freqVar, roundBase = 3, hierarchies = NULL,
  formula = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Input data as a data frame (inner cells)}

\item{freqVar}{Variable holding counts (inner cells frequencies)}

\item{roundBase}{Rounding base}

\item{hierarchies}{List of hierarchies}

\item{formula}{Model formula defining publishable cells}

\item{...}{Further parameters sent to \code{RoundViaDummy}}
}
\value{
Output is a four-element list with class attribute "PLSrounded" (to ensure informative printing).
   \item{inner}{Data frame corresponding to input data with the main dimensional variables and with cell 
               frequencies (original, rounded, difference).}
   \item{publish}{Data frame of publishable data with the main dimensional variables and with cell frequencies 
                  (original, rounded, difference).}
   \item{metrics}{A named character vector of various statistics calculated from the two output data frames 
   ("\code{inner_}" used to distinguish). See examples below and the function \code{\link{HDutility}}.}
   \item{freqTable}{Matrix of frequencies of cell frequencies and absolute differences.
   For example, row "\code{rounded}" and column "\code{pub.4+}" is the number of rounded 
   inner cell frequencies greater than or equal to \code{4}.}
}
\description{
Small count rounding of necessary inner cells are performed so that all small frequencies of cross-classifications to be published 
(publishable cells) are rounded. The publishable cells can be defined from a model formula, hierarchies or automatically from data.
}
\details{
This function is a user-friendly wrapper for \code{RoundViaDummy} with data frame output and with computed summary of the results.
See \code{\link{RoundViaDummy}} for more details.

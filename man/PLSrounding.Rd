\usage{
PLSrounding(
  data,
  freqVar = NULL,
  roundBase = 3,
  hierarchies = NULL,
  formula = NULL,
  dimVar = NULL,
  maxRound = roundBase - 1,
  printInc = nrow(data) > 1000,
  output = NULL,
  preAggregate = is.null(freqVar),
  ...
)

PLSroundingInner(..., output = "inner")

PLSroundingPublish(..., output = "publish")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Input data as a data frame (inner cells)}

\item{freqVar}{Variable holding counts (inner cells frequencies).  When \code{NULL} (default), microdata is assumed.}

\item{roundBase}{Rounding base}

\item{hierarchies}{List of hierarchies}

\item{formula}{Model formula defining publishable cells}

\item{dimVar}{The main dimensional variables and additional aggregating variables. This parameter can be  useful when hierarchies and formula are unspecified.}

\item{maxRound}{Inner cells contributing to original publishable cells equal to or less than maxRound will be rounded}

\item{printInc}{Printing iteration information to console when TRUE}

\item{output}{Possible non-NULL values are \code{"input"}, \code{"inner"} and \code{"publish"}. Then a single data frame is returned.}

\item{preAggregate}{When \code{TRUE}, the data will be aggregated beforehand within the function by the dimensional variables.}

\item{...}{Further parameters sent to \code{RoundViaDummy}}
}
\value{
Output is a four-element list with class attribute "PLSrounded" (to ensure informative printing).
\item{inner}{Data frame corresponding to input data with the main dimensional variables and with cell
frequencies (original, rounded, difference).}
\item{publish}{Data frame of publishable data with the main dimensional variables and with cell frequencies
(original, rounded, difference).}
\item{metrics}{A named character vector of various statistics calculated from the two output data frames
("\code{inner_}" used to distinguish). See examples below and the function \code{\link{HDutility}}.}
\item{freqTable}{Matrix of frequencies of cell frequencies and absolute differences.
For example, row "\code{rounded}" and column "\code{inn.4+}" is the number of rounded
inner cell frequencies greater than or equal to \code{4}.}
}
\description{
Small count rounding of necessary inner cells are performed so that all small frequencies of cross-classifications to be published
(publishable cells) are rounded. The publishable cells can be defined from a model formula, hierarchies or automatically from data.
}
\details{
This function is a user-friendly wrapper for \code{RoundViaDummy} with data frame output and with computed summary of the results.
See \code{\link{RoundViaDummy}} for more details.
